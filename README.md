# setup
firstly, you need to configure the config which can be found [here](https://github.com/Wyliemaster/GDPS-Bot/blob/master/botsettings.json). the image below shows the important parts of the config.

- The bot token is what is used to make your bot work on discord
- The Prefix is what you use to use commands ``x!profile``, ``x!level``
- the server is what server the bot works for.
